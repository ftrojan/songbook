[Chorus]
Eb  Cm    Gm           Eb7
Somewhere over the rainbow
Ab  Abmaj7  Gm7  Eb Gm7 Edim
Way up      high
Ab6     Abm6 Eb          C9
There's a    land that I heard of
F7        Fm Bb7 Eb  Fm7 Bb9
once in a lullaby
Eb  Cm    Gm           Eb7
Somewhere over the rainbow
Ab  Abmaj7 Ab7 Gm7  Eb Gm7 Edim
Skies are      blue
Ab6     Abm6 Eb              C9
And     the  dreams that you dare to
F7           Fm Bb7  Eb
dream really do come true

[Verse 2]
Eb                  Eb6  Eb
Someday I'll wish upon a star
    Fm7                          Bb7 Eb6      Bb Ab Eb
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Bb7   Eb
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Cdim
Away above the chimney tops
       Fm6   Ebm Cdim  Fm7  Bb9
That's where you'll    find me

[Chorus]
Eb  Cm    Gm           Eb7
Somewhere over the rainbow
Ab   Abmaj7 Ab7  Gm7 Eb Gm7 Edim
Blue birds       fly
Ab6   Abm6 Eb       C9
Birds fly  over the rainbow
F7          Fm  Bb7   Eb  Bb9
Why then oh why can't I?
   Eb                             Fm7
If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow
Bb7              Eb6
Why oh why can't I?
