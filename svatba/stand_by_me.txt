1. When the night has come
Emi                Emi
   And the land is dark
           C           D                G   G
   And the moon is the only light we'll see

   No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid

2. If the sky that we look upon
Emi                  Emi
   Should tumble and fall

   And the mountains should crumble to the sea

   I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear

   Just as long as you stand, stand by me
