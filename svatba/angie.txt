Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?

With no lovin' in our souls
and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried.

Angie, you're beautiful, yeah,
but ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?

All the dreams were held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here

[solo 2 kolečka]

Oh, Angie, don't you weep
Oh, your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye? Yeah

[solo 1 kolečko]

With no lovin' in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied

Angie, I still love you, baby
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on, baby, dry your eyes

But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried.
