[Verse]
F      B         F
Sunday morning
F          B        F
Brings the dawn in
F/E          Dm              G      C
It's just a restless feeling by my side
F     B         F
Early dawning
F      B        F
Sunday Morning
F/E           Dm           G           C
It's just the wasted years so close behind

[Chorus]
F            B                 F
Watchout the worlds behind ya
F                  B
Theres always some one around ya
         Gm                      Eb    C
who will call... it's nothin at all

[Verse]
F      B         F
Sunday Morning
F       B        F
And I'm falling
F/E         Dm
I've got a feeling
       G         C
I dont want to know.
F     B         F
Early dawning
F      B        F
Sunday morning
F/E           Dm
It's all the streets you crossed
    G         C
not so long ago

[Chorus]
F            B                 F
Watchout the worlds behind ya
F                  B
Theres always some one around ya
         Gm                      Eb    C
who will call... it's nothin at all

[Solo]

[Chorus]
F            B                 F
Watchout the worlds behind ya
F                  B
Theres always some one around ya
         Gm                      Eb    C
who will call... it's nothin at all

[Outro]
F      B         F
Sunday morning
F      B         F
Sunday morning
F      B         F
Sunday morning...
