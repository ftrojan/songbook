[Verse]
    Fmaj Eb7          Am7  D7
The  days, of wine and  ro – ses,
          Gm        Gm7        Eb9
Laugh and run away,     like a child, at play,
            Am7    Am      Dm    Dm7     Gm
Through the meadow land toward a closing door,
  Em7b5 A7b9            Dm7   G7
A door marked nev - er - more,
      Gm7            C7
that wasn't there before.

[Verse]
     Fmaj  Eb7          Am7      D7
The lone - ly  night, dis - clo – ses,
     Gm              Gm7             Eb9
Just a passing breeze,    filled with memories,
       Am7               Dm                  Bm7b5 E7b9
Of the golden smile that in - tro - duced me to,
    Am      Dm7      Gm7  E7
The days of wine and roses,
Am           Dm7     Gm7    C7      Fmaj7
the days of wine and roses      and you.
