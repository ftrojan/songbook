[Verse 1]
           Em                    Bm
Just as I thought it was going alright,
                 Em                         Bm
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right,
                 Em                Bm             Em
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all.
            Am7                D
I could say day, and you'd say night,
             Am7                         D
Tell me it's black when I know that it's white
           Am7               D             Em
Always the same, it's just a shame, that's all.
 

[Chorus]
         G                              Am7                 D
I could leave but I won't go, though my heart might tell me so,
         G                   GMaj7              Am    D
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes.
               Em           Bm
So why does it always seem to be,
                Em                           Bm
He's lookin' at you and you were lookin' at me,
                Em                 D             Em
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all.
 

[Verse 2]
Em                           Bm
Turnin' me on, turnin' me off,
          Em                    Bm
Makin' me feel like I want too much,
             Em                     D                    Em
Livin' with you just'a puttin' me through it all of the time.
         Am                      D
Runnin' around, stayin' out all night,
          Am                       D
Takin' it all 'stead of takin' one bite
            Am                     D                    Em
Livin' with you just'a puttin' me through it all of the time.

 
[Chorus]
     G                              Am7                 D
I could leave but I won't go, itâ€™d be easier I know,
         G                   GMaj7              Am    D
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes.
               Em           Bm
So why does it always seem to be,
                Em                           Bm
He's lookin' at you and you were lookin' at me,
                Em                 D             Em
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all.

 

[Bridge]
Cmaj7
Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to,
                            Em
There's no point in trying, to pretend.
Cmaj7
There's been no-one who, makes me feel like you do,
                       Em
Say we'll be together, till the end.
