[Verse 1]
      G                   D7
Last Saturday night I got married
                        G
Me and the wife settled down
          G7       C      A
Me and my wife are parted
      D7                      G
Gonna take another stroll downtown


[Chorus]
G         D7
Irene goodnight
          G
Irene goodnight
           G7        C       A
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
     D7             G
I'll see you in my dreams


[Verse 2]
          G                   D7
Stop your ramblin', Stop your gamblin'
                                    G
Stop your stayin' out late, late at night
                G7            C      A
Go home to your wife and your family
 D7                   G
Stay by your fireside bright


[Chorus]
G         D7
Irene goodnight
          G
Irene goodnight
           G7        C       A
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
     D7             G
I'll see you in my dreams

Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
     D7             G
I'll see you in my dreams
           G7        C       A
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
     D7             G
I'll see you in my dreams
