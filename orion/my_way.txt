   D               Dmaj7
And now the end is near
         D7             H7
And so I face the final curtain
      Em7                 Em7/D
My friend, I'll say it  clear
               Em7/C#   A7       D
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

      D                       D7
I've lived     a life that's full
               G              Gm
I've travelled each and every highway
     D                   A
And more, much more than this
   Asus4  G  D
I did it my way

   D                 Dmaj7
Regrets, I've had a few
           D7               H7
But then again, too few to mention
   Em7              Em7/D
I did what I had to do
            Em7/C#      A7     D
And saw it through  without  exemption

     D                  D7
I planned each charted course
               G             Gmi
Each careful step along the byway
    D                    A
And more, much more than this
   Asus4  G  D
I did it my way

[Chorus]
 A              D                   D7
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
           G                     Gsus4
When I bit off more than I could chew
               Em              A7
But through it all when there was doubt
         F#m            Hm
I ate it up and spit it out
           Em                A
I faced it all, and I stood tall
     Asus4  G  D
And did it my way

      D                      Dmaj7
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
            D7                 H7
I've had my fill, my share of losing
    Em7             Em7/D
And now as tears subside
          Em7/C#  A7   D
I find it all     so amusing
     D                   D7
To think     I did all that
           G                 Gm
And may I say, not in a shy way
 D             Asus4
No, oh no not me
          G  D
I did it my way

[Chorus]
      A        D                D7
For what is a man, what has he got
           G
If not himself, then he has naught
           Em7               A7
To say the things, he truly feels
             F#m              Hm7
And not the words of one who kneels
            Em7                A
The record shows, I took the blows
            G  D
And did it my way

A  D  Dmaj7  D7  G  Gm  D  F#m  Hm

 A           G   D
Yes, it was my way
