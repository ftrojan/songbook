Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance with the

cover of October skies
         Gm7            Am7     Gm7     Am7
All the leaves on the trees are falling to the

Sounds of the breezes that blow

Heartstrings that play soft and low

In your blush

I can't wait 'til the morning has come
        Gm7         Am7     Gm7            Am7
And I know now the time is just right
             Gm7     Am7            Gm7    Am7
And straight into my arms you will run

There and then I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just
  Cm7      Gm7
Tremble inside
             Cm7      Gm7             Cm7
Then I know ho-o-o-w much you want me,    that
           D7
You can't hide
