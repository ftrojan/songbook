[Verse 1 - A]
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting

[Verse 2 - B]
And through these moments apart
memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
