C C/G E7 Am D7 Dm7 G7

[Verse 1 - A]
               C         Cmaj7
You give your hand to me
              C            C7
and then you say, "Hello."
           F
and I can hardly speak,
             Cdim7
my heart is beating so.
       C           A7
And anyone can tell
                Dm7         G7
You think you know me well.
                  Emi7   Ami7 Dmi7 G7
Well, you don't know me.

[Verse 2 - B]
No you don't know the one
who dreams of you at night
and longs to kiss your lips
and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend,
that's all I've ever been.
                  C      F  C   C7
Cause you don't know me.

[Chorus - C]
F             Cdim7  C                A7
For I never knew the art of making love,
Dm7        G7               C           E7
Though my heart aches with love for you.
Ami                Emi              A7
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by.
D7                               G  G+
A chance that you might love me too.

[Verse 3 - B]
You give your hand to me,
And then you say, "Goodbye."
I watched you walk away,
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never know
The one who loved you so.
Well, you don't know me

[solo - B]

[Chorus - C]
F             Cdim7  C                A7
For I never knew the art of making love,
Dm7        G7               C           E7
Though my heart aches with love for you.
Ami                Emi              A7
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by.
D7                               G  G#7
A chance that you might love me too.
