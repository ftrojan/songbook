No you don't know the one
who dreams of you at night
and longs to kiss your lips
and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend,
that's all I've ever been.

Cause you don't know me.(no you don't know me)

And then you say, "Goodbye."
I watched you walk away,
Beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never know
The one who loved you so.
Well, you don't know me
