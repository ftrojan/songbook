[Verse 1 - A]
              B                 F
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill,
              C  C7               F  F7
on Blueberry Hill, where I found you.
                 B                  F
The moon stood still, on Blueberry Hill,
     D          Gm C                F  B  F
and lingered until my dreams came true.

[Chorus - B]
     C           F
The wind in the willow played
         C        F  F7
love's sweet melody,
    E7            Am           E7
but all of those vows you made,
               A7 C7
were never to be

 C7            B                        F
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
     D             Gm  C             F    B  F
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.

[solo - A] trubka

[Chorus - B]
     C           F
The wind in the willow played
         C        F  F7
love's sweet melody,
    E7            Am           E7
but all of those vows you made,
              A7 C7
were only to be


 C7            B                        F
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
D                  Gm  C             F   B  F
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.
