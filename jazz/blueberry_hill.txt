I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill,
 G                     C     F     C
on Blueberry Hill, where I found you.

The moon stood still, on Blueberry Hill,
 G                     C     F     C
and lingered until my dreams came true.

 G             C
The wind in the willow played
 G        C   F   C
love's sweet melody,
 D7              G
but all of those vows we made,
 D7         G
were never to be

 G7       F                          C      F   C
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
 G                   C       F   C
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.
