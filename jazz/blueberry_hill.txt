[Verse 1 - A]
              C                 G
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill,
              D  D7               G  G7
on Blueberry Hill, where I found you.
                 C                  G
The moon stood still, on Blueberry Hill,
     E          Am D                G  C  G
and lingered until my dreams came true.

[Chorus - B]
     D           G
The wind in the willow played
         D        G  G7
love's sweet melody,
    F#7           Hm           F#7
but all of those vows you made,
               H7 D7
were never to be

 D7            C                        G
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
     E             Am  D             G    C  G
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.

[Chorus - B]
     D           G
The wind in the willow played
         D        G  G7
love's sweet melody,
    F#7           Hm           F#7
but all of those vows you made,
              H7 D7
were only to be

 D7            C                        G
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
E                  Am  D             G   C  G
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.
