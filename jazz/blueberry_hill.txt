Milan intro, pak bubny trioly na cinely
[Verse 1]
              F                 C
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill,
              G                     C  F  C
on Blueberry Hill, where I found you.
                 F                  C     F  C
The moon stood still, on Blueberry Hill,
     A          Dm                  C  F  C
and lingered until my dreams came true.

[Chorus]
     G           C
The wind in the willow played
         G        C  C7
love's sweet melody,
    H7            Em           H7
but all of those vows you made,
               E7 G
were never to be

 G7            F                        C   F C
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
     A             Dm                C    F  C
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.

[Chorus] - solo, nemusi se zpivat
     G           C
The wind in the willow played
         G        C  C7
love's sweet melody,
    H7            Em           H7
but all of those vows you made,
               E7 G
were only to be

 G7       F                          C      F   C
Though we're apart, you're part of me still,
     A             Dm                C
for you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill.
