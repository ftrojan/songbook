          The way you wear your hat
                      B7sus
The way you sip your tea
                    Bm7  Eb7
The memory of all that
              Abmaj7                    B7sus
No, no, they can't take that away from me

                         Ebmaj7
The way your smile just beams
                      B7sus
The way you sing off-key
                       Bm    Eb7
The way you haunt my dreams
              Abmaj7           B7       Eb6  D7
No, no, they can't take that away from me

D7      Gm     D7    Gm    D7
We may never, never meet again
        Gm    Ebmaj7  Abmaj7 D7
On that bumpy road to love
            Gm      D7      Gm       C7    F7
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

                        Ebmaj7
The way you hold your knife
                         B7sus
The way we danced 'til three
                           Bm7  Eb7
The way you've changed my life
              Abmaj7                    B7sus
No, no, they can't take that away from me
          C7               F7   B7  Ebmaj7
No, they can't take that away from me
