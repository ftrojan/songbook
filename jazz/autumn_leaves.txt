Dmi A7 Dmi

             Gmi    C7              F      B
The falling leaves     drift by my window.
             Gmi    A7             Dmi
The falling leaves     of red and gold.

            Gmi     C7             F     B
I see your lips,       the summer kisses,
               Gmi  A7            Dmi
the sunburned hands    I used to hold.


[Chorus]
           A7                      Dmi
Since you went away the days grow long
               Gmi C7          F     D7
And soon I'll hear old winter song
       Gmi     A7              Dmi    Dmi/C B
But i miss you most of all my darling
Gmi          A7              Dmi
When autumn leaves start to fall

[solo kytara]

[Chorus]
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter song
But i miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
