Dmi A7 Dmi

             Gmi    C7
The falling leaves
             F      B
Drift by my window.
             Gmi   A7          Dmi
The falling leaves of red and gold.

            Gmi  C7
I see your lips,
            F     B
the summer kisses,
               Gmi  A7         Dmi
the sunburned hands I used to hold.

[Chorus]
           A7
Since you went away
               Dmi
the days grow long
               Gmi C7          F
And soon I'll hear old winter song
       Gmi     A7              Dmi    Dmi/C B
But i miss you most of all my darling
Gmi          A7              Dmi
When autumn leaves start to fall

[solo kytara]

[Chorus]
Since you went away
the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter song
But i miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

[solo kytara]
