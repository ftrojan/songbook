[Verse 1 - A]
F       Cdim7          Gmi7 C7
Stars shining bright above you,
F       E      Eb       D          D7
night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you".
Gmi7                Bmi7
Birds singing in the sycamore tree,
   F              C#7 C7  F  C7
"Dream a little dream of me".

[Verse 2 - B]
F     Cdim7          Gmi7    C7
Say "nighty-night" and kiss me.
F     E       Eb        D              D7
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me.
Gmi7                 Bmi7
While I'm alone and blue as can be,
  F              C#7 C7  F   G#
dream a little dream of me.

[Chorus]
C#     Bmi7      Ebmi7    G#7
Stars fading, but I linger on, dear.
C#      Bmi7      Ebmi7   G#7
Still craving your kiss,
C#   Bmi7      Ebmi7      G#7
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear.
C#            C7
Just saying this:

[Verse 3 - B]
F       Cdim7         Gmi7  C7
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.
F       E          Eb        D         D7
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.
Gmi7                   Bmi7
But in your dreams whatever they be,
  F              C#7 C7  F   C7
dream a little dream of me.
