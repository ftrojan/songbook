[Intro]
F    C    B    C

[Verse 1]
 F                              Fmaj7
Raindrops keep falling on my head
     F7                                 B                 Ami
and just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed,
 D7                 Ami     D7      Gm7
nothing seems to fit, Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'

[Verse 2]
 C7          F                            Fmaj7
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun,
     F7                         B                   Ami
and I said I didn't like the way he got things done
 D7                Ami     D7      Gmi7
Sleepin' on the job, Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'

[Chorus]
 C7                F         Fmaj7
But there's one thing I know,
      B                  C                Ami
the blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
                       D7                Gm7             B    C    B    C
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

[Verse 3]
   F                            Fmaj7
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head,
     F7                               B                 Ami
but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red,
 D7                Ami     D7      Gmi7
Cryin's not for me, cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
 C7            F       C7
because I'm free, nothings worryin' me

[interlude]
F  Fmaj7  B  C  Ami

                       D7                Gmi7             B    C    B    C
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
