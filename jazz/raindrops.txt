[Intro]
F    C    B    C

[Verse 1 - A]
 F                              Fmaj7
Raindrops keep falling on my head
     F7
and just like the guy whose feet are
 B               Am7
too big for his bed,
 D7               Am7   D7
nothing seems to fit, those
 Gm7
raindrops are fallin' on my
 Gm7                   C7
head they keep fallin'

[Verse 2 - A]
           F                          Fmaj7
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun,
     F7
and I said I didn't like the
 B                 Am7
way he got things done
 D7              Am7   D7
Sleepin' on the job, those
 Gm7
raindrops are fallin' on my
 Gm7                   C7
head they keep fallin'

[Chorus - B]
                  F       Fmaj7
But there's one thing I know,
      B                  C                Am7
the blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
    Am7
It won't be long till
 D7             Gm7            C B C  C B C
happiness steps up to greet me

[Verse 3]
 F                            Fmaj7
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head,
      F7
but that doesn't mean my eyes will
 B               Am7
soon be turnin' red,
 D7              Am7 D7
Cryin's not for me, cause
Gm7
I'm never gonna stop the
 Gm7                C7
rain by complainin'    because I'm
  F             C7       F
free, nothings worryin' me

[interlude - B]
F  Fmaj7  B  C  Am7
    Am7
It won't be long till
 D7             Gm7          B  C  B  C
happiness steps up to greet me
