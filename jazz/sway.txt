[Intro]
| Gm6/Bb A7  | Gm6/Bb A7  | Dm      | Dm      |
| Gm6/Bb A7  | Gm6/Bb A7  | Dm      | Dm      |

[Verse 1]
                      Gm
When marimba rhythms start to play
Gm             Dm
Dance with me, make me sway
Dm                Gm
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
A7             Dm
Hold me close, sway me more


[Verse 2]
                      Gm
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Gm            Dm
Bend with me, sway with ease
Dm                       Gm
When we dance you have a way with me
A7            Dm
Stay with me, sway with me


[Chorus]
                  C
Other dancers may be on the floor, dear
                 F
But my eyes will see only you
                   A7
Only you have that magic technique
                  Bb                  A7
When we sway I go weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaak


[Verse 3]
                         Gm
I can hear the sounds of violins
Gm          Dm
Long before it begins
Dm                     Gm
Make me thrill as only you know how
A7              Dm
Sway me smooth, sway me now


[Interlude]
| Gm6/Bb A7  | Gm6/Bb A7  | Dm      | Dm      |
| Gm6/Bb A7  | Gm6/Bb A7  | Dm      | Dm      |


[Chorus]
                  C
Other dancers may be on the floor, dear
                 F
But my eyes will see only you
                   A7
Only you have that magic technique
                  Bb                  A7
When we sway I go weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaak

 
[Verse 4]
                         Gm
I can hear the sounds of violins
Gm          Dm
Long before it begins
Dm                     Gm
Make me thrill as only you know how
A7              Dm
Sway me smooth, sway me now


[Verse 5]
                      Gm
When marimba rhythms start to play
Gm             Dm
Dance with me, make me sway
Dm                Gm
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
A7             Dm
Hold me close, sway me more
