[Verse 1]
Gm                     Adim7    D7
When marimba rhythms start to play
Adim7       D7  Gm6
Dance with me, make me sway
Gm6               Cm         D7
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
 Cm       D7     Gm6
Hold me close, sway me more

[Verse 2]
Gm6                   Adim7    D7
Like a flower bending in the breeze
 Adim7     D7   Gm6
Bend with me, sway with ease
Gm6                       Cm       D7
When we dance you have a way with me
  Cm       D7   Gm6
Stay with me, sway with me

[Chorus]
                   F7
Other dancers may be on the floor, dear
                  Bmaj7
But my eyes will see only you
                    D7
Only you have that magic technique
                  Eb7     D7
When we sway I go weeeeaaaak

[Verse 3]
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
