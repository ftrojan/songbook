[Intro] trubka
Cmi Cmi Gmi Gmi
Cmi D7  Gmi Gmi

[Verse 1]
Gmi                    Cmi
When marimba rhythms start to play
Cmi             Gmi
Dance with me, make me sway
Gmi                Cmi
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
 D7              Gmi
Hold me close, sway me more

[Verse 2]
Gmi                   Cmi
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Cmi             Gmi
Bend with me, sway with ease
Gmi                       Cmi
When we dance you have a way with me
D7             Gmi
Stay with me, sway with me

[Chorus]
                   F
Other dancers may be on the floor, dear
                  B
But my eyes will see only you
                    D7
Only you have that magic technique
                  Eb7     D7
When we sway I go weeeeaaaak

[Verse 3]
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

When we sway I go weeeeaaaak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

[Verse 5]
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
