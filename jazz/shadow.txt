[Verse 1]
    Am7            Hm7         E7      Am7  D7
The shadow of your smile, when you are gone,
     D7            Dm7        G7         Cmaj7   Fmaj7
Will colour all my dreams and light the dawn.

[Bridge]
Fmaj7          Hm7b5    E7        Am7  Am/G
   Look into my eyes, my love, and see,
Am7              F#m7b5     H7b9        Hm7b5 E7
  All the lovely things you are,    to me.

[Verse 2]
                   Hm7         E7      Am7   D7
Our wistful little star,   was far too high,
                        Dm7            G7    Em7b5  A7
A teardrop kissed your lips, and so did I.

[Chorus]
           Dm7              Fm7
Now when I remember spring,
        Bb7      Em7            A7
All the joy that love can bring,
          D7           Dm7
I will be remembering,
    G7               C
The shadow of your smile.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
