     C7             G7
I'm feeling mighty lonesome
C7               G7
Haven't slept a wink
   C7                 G7
I walk the floor and watch the door
    C7     C7/B   C7/A C7/G  F7
And in between I drink
  F7
Black coffee
                      C7  G7 C7
Love's a hand me down  brew
     Dmi7                Gb7 F7
I'll never see a Sunday
F7               C7  G7 C7 G7
In this weekday room


I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday tear's too dry


       Fmi                 C7
Now a man is born to go a lovin'
   Fmi                       Cmaj7
A woman's born to weep and fret
     Ebmi            Ab7     Dbmaj7
To stay at home and tend her oven
      Ebmi7            Ab7
And drown her past regrets
    Dmi7           G7
In coffee and cigarettes


I'm moody all the morning
Mournin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
                  A7        Dmi7               G7
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

Dmi7
My nerves have gone to pieces
Fmi7
My hair is turning gray
F7
All I do is drink black coffee
G7                    C7
Since my man's gone away
