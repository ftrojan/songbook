[Intro]
Gm7 C7 F D7 Dm7 C7 D
 
[Verse 1]
              Gm7      Gm7/D
Mnnn C'est si bon
C7                     Fm7    Bbm7
  Lovers say that in France
Am7          D7        Gm7      Gm7/D
  When they thrill to romance
C7                     Fm7       Bbm7
  It means that it´s so good

[Verse 2]
Am7        Abm7 Gm7      Gm7/D
 Ooo C´est si bon
C7               Fm7    Bbm7
   So I say to you
Am7           D7          Gm7      Gm7/D
   Like the French people do
C7                      Fm7       Bbm7
   Because it´s oh so good
 
[Chorus]
A7       Dbm7        Dbm7  C7    Dbm7      Dm7/C#
   Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Eb7/C# Dbm7     Dm7      G7
       Leads to only one thought
         Gm7    C
And it's there still
 
[Verse 3]
N.C          Gm7
  Mmm It's so good
C7                     Fm7    Bbm7
  Nothing else can replace
Am7           D7     Gm7      Gm7/D
  Just your slyest embrace
C7               Adim7     D7
 And if you only would
       Gm    Bbmin7            Am7
Be all my own for the rest of my days
D7                 Gm7
I will whisper this phrase
    C13             F    Db F
Mi'darlin C'est si bon!
