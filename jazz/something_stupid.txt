[Intro]
 Am    D7    Am    D7    G

    G            G6
I know I stand in line until you
  G                 G6              Am               D7    Am    D7
think you have the time to spend an evening with me
    Am           D7            Am                D7
And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance
          G                G6    G    G6
you won't be leaving with me
     G            G9            G              G9
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
        Cm6           Cm
And have a drink or two
     Am            D7            Am             D7
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
        G      G6    G    G6
like I love you

       G               G9                G              G9
I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lines
           Cm6
you heard the night before
     A
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
             D7
and never seemed so right before

   G          G6           G           G6
I practice everyday to find some clever lines to say
         Am                D7    Am    D7
to make the meaning come true
     Am                D7            Am          D7
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
     G             G6    G    G6
And I'm alone with you
     G                 G9          G             G9
The time is right your perfume fills my head the stars get red
        Cm6            Cm
and on the nights so blue
     Am            D7            Am             D7
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
        G      G6    G    G6
like I love you
