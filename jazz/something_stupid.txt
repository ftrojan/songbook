[Intro]
Am7  D7   Am7  D7   G    G    G    G

[Verse 1 - A]
    G
I know I stand in line until you
  G
think you have the time to spend an
Am7           D7    Am7    D7
evening with me
    Am7            D7
And if we go someplace to dance
    Am7                 D7
I know that there's a chance
              G
you won't be leaving with me

[Verse 2 - B]
     G
And afterwards we drop into
    G7
a quiet little place and have a
  Cmaj7        Cm7
drink or two
     Am7            D7
And then I go and spoil it all
    Am7                D7
by saying something stupid
        G
like I love you

[Verse 3 - C]
       G
I can see it in your eyes that you
    G7
despise the same old lies
               Cmaj7
you heard the night before
     A7
And though it's just a line to you
     A7
for me it's true It never seemed so
 D7
right before

[Verse 4 - A]
    G
I practice everyday to find some
  G
clever lines to say
             Am7               D7    Am7   D7
to make the meaning come true
     Am7               D7
But then I think I'll wait until the
Am7         D7
evening gets late and I'm
  G
alone with you

[Verse 5 - B]
     G
The time is right your perfume fills my
 G7
head the stars get red
            Cmaj7          Cm7
and oh the night's so blue
     Am7           D7
And then I go and spoil it all by
 Am7               D7
saying something stupid
        G
like I love you

[Verse 5 - B]
     G
The time is right your perfume fills my
 G7
head the stars get red
            Cmaj7         Cm7
and oh the night's so blue
     Am7           D7
And then I go and spoil it all by
 Am7               D7
saying something stupid
        G      Eb
like I love you

[Outro]

   G         Eb
I love you
