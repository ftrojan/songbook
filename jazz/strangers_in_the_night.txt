[Intro]
F  D#7  B7  C C7

   F                   Fmaj7
Strangers in the night       exchanging glances
Wondering in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
 Dm                     Gm
Before the night was through

Gm7
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
 C7                                        Fmaj7
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Am7-5
Strangers in the night, two lonely people
           D7
We were strangers in the night
                          Gm7
Up to the moment when we said our first hello

 Bm6
Little did we know
 F                Dm7
Love was just a glance away
   Gm7            C7
A warm embracing dance away
    Fmaj7
And ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
Gm7                    C7                    F
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
