 Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars,
  C   Am6   H7   Em   E7
 Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars;

In other words, hold my hand;

In other words, darling, kiss me.

 Fill my heart with song, and let me sing for ever more;

You are all I long for, all I wor-ship and adore.
