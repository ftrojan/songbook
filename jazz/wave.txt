[Verse 1]
               Dmaj7
So close your eyes
       Bdim7                  Am7   D7
For that's a lovely way to be
           Gmaj7             Gm6
Aware of things your heart alone was
          F#6  H7
meant to see
                 E9
The fundamental loneliness goes
           B7              A7     Dm7   G7 Dm7 G7
whenever two can dream a dream together
Dm7 G7 Dm7 G7

[Verse 2]
             Dmaj7     Bdim7                  Am7  D7
You can't deny don't try to fight the rising sea
                 Gmaj7            Gm6
Don't fight the moon, the stars above
                 F#6 H7
and don't fight me
                 E9
The fundamental loneliness goes
           B7              A7     Dm7   G7 Dm7 G7
whenever two can dream a dream together
Dm7 G7 Dm7 G7

[Chorus]
Gm7             C7                 Fmaj7
When I saw you first the time was half past three
Fm7                B7/Ab         Ebmaj7   A7
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

[Verse 3]
            Dmaj7   Bdim7                 Am7 D7
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
                 Gmaj7           Gm6
Just catch that wave don't be afraid
           F#6 H7
of loving me
                 E9
The fundamental loneliness goes
           B7              A7     Dm7   G7 Dm7 G7
whenever two can dream a dream together
Dm7 G7 Dm7 G7
