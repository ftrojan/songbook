           Ebmaj7 D7            Gmaj7
Night and day,      you are the one
      Ebmaj7         D7               Gmaj7
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
         C#dim7        Cm7
Whether near to me or far
         Hm7                Bdim7
It's no matter, darling,  where you are
    Am7        D7          Gmaj7
I think of you    day and night

Night and day, why is it so
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

[Chorus]
Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearnin burnin inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you
Day and night, night and day

[Instrumental]

Night and day, you are the one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you day and night

Night and day, why is it so
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
Silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend life makin' love to you
Day and night, night and day
