[Verse 1 - A]
           Ebmaj7 D7            Gmaj7
Night and day,      you are the one
      Ebmaj7         D7               Gmaj7
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
         C#dim7        Cm7
Whether near to me or far
         Hm7                Bdim7
It's no matter, darling,  where you are
    Am7        D7          Gmaj7
I think of you    day and night

[Verse 2 - A]
           Ebmaj7 D7           Gmaj7
Night and day,      why is it so
           Ebmaj7          D7                 Gmaj7
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
        C#dim7            Cm7
In the roarin' traffic's boom
        Hm7           Bdim7
In the silence of my lonely room
    Am7        D7          Gmaj7
I think of you    day and night

[Chorus - B]
           Bmaj7          Gmaj7
Night and day, under the hide of me
           Bmaj7                              Gmaj7
There's an oh such a hungry yearnin burnin inside of me
         C#dim7             Cm7
And its torment won't be through
          Hm7             Bdim7               Am7
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you
         D7               G6
Day and night, night and day
