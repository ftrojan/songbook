[Verse 1]
          C                 E7
Grab your coat and get your hat,
           F               G7
Leave your worries on the doorstep;
Am               D7
Just direct your feet
       Dm7                  G7
To the sunny side of the street.

[Verse 2]
          C               E7
Can't you hear the pitter-pat?
         F              Fm
And that happy tune is your  step!
Am              D7
Life can be so sweet
       Dm7   G7           C
On the sunny side of the street.

[Bridge]
          C7                              F
I used to walk in the shade, with those blues on parade;
    D7                     G7            Dm7  G7
But I'm not afraid -- this rover crossed over!

[Verse 3]
     C           E7
If I never had a cent,
       F             G7
I'd be rich as Rockefeller,
Am              D7
Gold dust at my feet
       Dm7   G7          C
On the sunny side of the street.
