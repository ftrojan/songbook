And it shows them pearly white
         Gmi                  Cmi
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe

Scarlet billows start to spread

Fancy gloves, though wears old MacHeath, babe
             F7                      B                        F#7

Lies a body oozin' life
                 G#mi               C#mi
And someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
             F#7                  B    G7

And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
