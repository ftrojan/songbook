Hey watermelon man
Hey watermelon man
Bring me one that rattles when you plug it
One that's erd and juicy when you plug it
Do you understand watermelon man

Hey watermelon man
Hey watermelon man
Hot and bothered need a little cooling
When I hear your call I start to drooling
Do you understand watermelon man
