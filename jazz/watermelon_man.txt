[Chorus]

Hey watermelon man
B               F
Hey watermelon man

[Verse 1]
C                  B
Bring me one that rattles when you lug it
C                        B
One that's erd and juicy when you plug it
C             B               F
Do you understand watermelon man

[Chorus]
F
Hey watermelon man
B               F
Hey watermelon man

[Verse 2]
C                  B
Hot and bothered, need a little cooling
C                 B
When I hear your call I start to drooling
C             B                 F
Do you understand? Watermelon man

[Bridge]
So sweet, so cool and so red
So green and so nice
Cool you down, just like ice
Take a taste, and see why
If you hot, or dry, just take a slice. Eat your fill
Cool you down! Yes it will

[Chorus]
F
Hey watermelon man
B               F
Hey watermelon man

[Verse 3]
C                  B
Hot and bothered, need a little cooling
C                 B
When I hear your call I start to drooling
C             B                F
Do you understand? Watermelon man

[Outro]
F   F   F   F
F   F   F   F
