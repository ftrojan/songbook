I see trees of green, red roses too
Gm7         F     A7         Dm
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      Db              Gm7/C
And I think to myself,
         C7       F      F+ Bbmaj7 C7
what a  wonderful world.

       F         Am  Bb             Am
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
Gm7                 F   A7               Dm
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
      Db              Gm7/C    C7        F      Bb C7
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world


    C7                        F
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
    C7                   F
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
      Dm              Ami       Dm                Ami
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
Dm             F#dim7   Gm7  F#dim7  Gm7     C7
They're really saying,  "I   love    you."   I hear

F       Am  Bb             Am
Babies cry, I watch them grow
Gm7                 F   A7               Dm
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
      Db              Gm7/C    C7        F      Am7b5
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
D7       Gm7             Gm7/C   C7b9      F    Bb6  F
   Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
